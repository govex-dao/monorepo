\begin{abstract}
We present a novel financial primitive where conditional outcomes exist in superposition until resolved by market consensus. Upon initiation of any conditional event—whether a governance proposal, insurance claim, prediction market, or payment contract—all possible outcome tokens are minted immediately. These tokens trade freely until a market-based uncertainty metric $\Delta P \times \Delta R$ falls below a threshold k, triggering deterministic "collapse" to a single outcome. If uncertainty remains high at deadline, probabilistic resolution based on market prices prevents indefinite lockup.
The protocol operates on a state budget rather than limiting concurrent events, allowing flexible combinations (e.g., the Cartesian product of 4 binary events or one 16-outcome event within a 16-state budget). Events can be entangled via logical dependencies, enabling complex conditional structures.
We demonstrate applications across multiple domains: (1) governance without voting, where proposals execute immediately via conditional tokens, (2) decentralized insurance with instant claim tokens that resolve based on oracle consensus, (3) trustless escrow where payments exist in superposition until conditions are verified. Anywhere society currently makes discrete choices under uncertainty OR uncertain discrete events happen, you can create superposition until information resolves. This protocol is quantum isomorphic.
