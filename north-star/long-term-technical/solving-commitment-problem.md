The [commitment issue](https://overcomingbias.com/p/futarchy-details#:~:text=The%20principle%20that%20occurs%20to%20me%20is%3A%20commitment.%20A%20key%20question%20in%20futarchy%20design%20is%20whether%20approved%20proposals%20can%20restrict%20future%20proposals.%20If%20yes%2C%20then%20proposals%20could%20be%20adopted%20early%20that%20prohibit%20certain%20defined%20redistribution%20proposals%20later.%C2%A0). 

If we create a classical prediction market on whether Company A will fire the CEO within the next 6 months. The company can use the price of the company's stock in the Hire and Keep conditional verses (partitions) to decide whether to fire or keep the CEO.

If we just use a regular futarchy market, nothing stops us from creating the same proposal every week. So there is less incentive to price Reject and Accept outcomes differently in any given proposal.





Because it allows us to look over the net benefits of a decision over 1 year. Not the next week.

And automatically takes that decision if it is +EV. 

DAO would need 3rd type of market that isn't KPI or Native Asset Futarchy.
It is a mix of the two.
