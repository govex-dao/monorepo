Hhard to figure out if cross dao proposals should be asynchronous. Or synced to end at the same time so traders in both daos can trade all combinations of outcomes in each daos token. 

DAO 1 token (Reject, Reject),(Acept, Reject),(Reject, Acept),(Acept, Acept)

DAO 2 token (Reject, Reject),(Acept, Reject),(Reject, Acept),(Acept, Acept) 

Makes 8 markets for what could be 4? is this realy efficent?

Syncing to end at same time likely means need to pay somehow to delay proposal in one daos prioirty queue, if there is one waiting? I.e pay to make the DAO do nothing. Possible DDOS vector here. This duggest state budget thing will be useful long term as it creates much more flexibility interms of when proposals can be created!  If we force proposal trading time to be same for all daos and for peoposals to run a set times e.g 9am would be easier to enforce sync cross dao proposals. E.g. each DAO must have 3 days proposals and they can only be created exactly everything 3 days...


have pre proposal first in each dao to sync out parameters and block out space in amm and then like 10 minutes fo a keeper bots to execute cross dao proposal
