Income Statement
What it answers: Are we profitable?
Simple Idea: Incomes - Expenses = Profit
Balance Sheet
What it answers: What do we own and owe?
Simple Idea: Resources = What You Owe (Liabilities + Equity)
Statement of Cash Flows
What it answers: Where did our cash go?
Simple Idea: Cash In - Cash Out = Change in Cash


What about employee numbers?
The number of employees is not a financial figure and does not appear on any of the three core statements. It is considered non-financial data. You would typically find this information in the company's Annual Report, often in the introductory sections or in the "Management's Discussion & Analysis" (MD&A).

Balance Sheet: This is its primary home. It's listed as an Asset, often under a category called "Property, Plant, and Equipment" (PP&E). It represents a store of value.

Statement of Stockholders' Equity: Explains the changes in the owners' portion of the company during the year (e.g., from profits, paying out dividends, or issuing new stock).
