This is a novel type of amm.
It has has a spot pool and when a proposal is created a set proportion of the liqudity is taken out of there and put into the conditional liqudiity. This proportion is a dao config, but has to be between 10 and 90%.

The conditinal markets a quantum hanson style liqudiity and coins.

So 1 spot USDC deposited goes to 1 USDC for each of the N outcomes.

When think about this system while a propsoal is live always model it an N conditional outcomes and n conditional outcomes.

Only on conditional outcome can win.

The conditional coins for that oucome can be redeemed for spot coin. The conditional AMM LP with be auto cranked back into the spot AMM.
