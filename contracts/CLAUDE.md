# Futarchy Contracts Deployment Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NEVER DELETE MODULES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**ABSOLUTELY DO NOT delete, remove, or comment out entire Move modules (.move files) without explicitly asking the user first.**

This includes:
- ‚ùå DO NOT delete entire .move files
- ‚ùå DO NOT remove module declarations
- ‚ùå DO NOT comment out entire modules
- ‚ùå DO NOT suggest "deleting deprecated modules" without explicit approval

**What you CAN do:**
- ‚úÖ Refactor functions within modules
- ‚úÖ Remove specific functions with user approval
- ‚úÖ Update function signatures
- ‚úÖ Add deprecation comments
- ‚úÖ Ask "Should I delete module X?" and wait for explicit "yes"

**When you encounter deprecated/unused code:**
1. Document it as deprecated in comments
2. Ask the user: "Module X appears deprecated. Should I delete it or refactor it?"
3. Wait for explicit instruction
4. DO NOT assume deletion is okay

## Sui Security Model

**Important Note**: Sui's execution model is atomic and does not have reentrancy risks like Ethereum. Race conditions are also unlikely due to Sui's object-centric model and transaction ordering guarantees. When you see defensive programming patterns in this codebase (like atomic check-and-delete patterns), they are primarily for code clarity and best practices rather than addressing actual race condition risks that would exist in other blockchain environments.

## BCS Serialization: Action Deserialization Patterns

**CRITICAL**: Use the correct pattern based on whether the action struct has fields.

### Empty Struct Actions (NO fields)

Empty structs serialize to **1+ bytes** in BCS (struct metadata), NOT 0 bytes.

**‚úÖ CORRECT Pattern**:
```move
// Get action_data but DON'T deserialize or validate
let _action_data = intents::action_spec_data(spec);
// Continue processing - nothing to deserialize
```

**‚ùå WRONG Pattern**:
```move
// DO NOT validate BCS consumption for empty structs!
let reader = bcs::new(*action_data);
bcs_validation::validate_all_bytes_consumed(reader); // FAILS with "trailing data"
```

### Non-Empty Struct Actions (HAS fields)

**‚úÖ CORRECT Pattern**:
```move
// Create reader, peel all fields, then validate
let mut reader = bcs::new(*action_data);
let field1 = bcs::peel_u64(&mut reader);
let field2 = bcs::peel_address(&mut reader);
// ... peel all fields ...
bcs_validation::validate_all_bytes_consumed(reader); // OK!
```

**Examples in Codebase**:
- ‚úÖ `transfer.move::do_transfer()` - Peels `recipient`, then validates
- ‚úÖ `currency.move::do_mint_and_transfer()` - Peels `amount`, then validates
- ‚úÖ `vault.move::do_deposit()` - Peels fields, then validates

### Why This Matters

1. **Empty structs**: BCS encoding includes struct metadata (1+ bytes). You cannot peel anything, and validation would fail on the unconsumed metadata byte(s).

2. **Non-empty structs**: MUST validate after peeling to prevent trailing data attacks where malicious actors append extra bytes.

### Rule of Thumb
- **No fields?** ‚Üí Get `_action_data`, don't process it
- **Has fields?** ‚Üí Peel all fields, then `validate_all_bytes_consumed()`

### TypeName Deserialization Issue

**Problem:** `TypeName` can be BCS-serialized but **cannot be deserialized** in Move (no public constructor).

**Why:** TypeName only has native constructors (`type_name::with_defining_ids<T>()`). You can serialize it to bytes, but you can't reconstruct it from bytes in Move.

**Solution:** Store structs containing TypeName as raw bytes, deserialize off-chain (SDK/frontend).

**Example:**
```move
// ‚úÖ Serialization works
let action = CouncilApproveIntentSpecAction { intent_spec, ... };
let bytes = bcs::to_bytes(&action);  // Contains TypeName inside InitActionSpecs

// ‚ùå Deserialization impossible in Move
// let action = bcs::from_bytes<CouncilApproveIntentSpecAction>(bytes); // NO SUCH FUNCTION

// ‚úÖ Store bytes, extract other fields, skip TypeName
let mut reader = bcs::new(bytes);
let action_count = bcs::peel_vec_length(&mut reader);
// Skip over the TypeName-containing fields
while (i < action_count) {
    let _type_bytes = bcs::peel_vec_u8(&mut reader);  // Skip TypeName as bytes
    let _data = bcs::peel_vec_u8(&mut reader);
    i = i + 1;
};
// Now extract other fields
let dao_id = bcs::peel_address(&mut reader);
```

**Real Example:** `approved_intent_spec.move` stores `intent_spec_bytes: vector<u8>` instead of `intent_spec: InitActionSpecs` because InitActionSpecs contains TypeName fields.

## Policy Enforcement System ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL

### Overview

The futarchy system has a **type-safe, multi-level policy enforcement system** for controlling what actions require council approval vs DAO approval. This is a **new governance primitive** that combines:

- **Type-safe policies** - Uses Move's type system for zero-cost policy granularity
- **Policy lock-in** - Stores policy data inline to prevent governance gridlock
- **Pre-approval system** - Prevents spam proposals that will fail
- **Three-tier hierarchy** - OBJECT > TYPE > ACTION (first match wins)

**Total Actions: 145**
- **31 parameterized actions** (can use TYPE-level policies with `<CoinType>`, `<AssetType, StableType>`, etc.)
- **114 non-parameterized actions** (use ACTION or OBJECT-level policies)

### Policy Hierarchy (OVERRIDE Semantics - First Match Wins)

Policies are checked in order, and **the first match is used** (subsequent levels are skipped):

**1. OBJECT policies** (highest priority) - Specific object IDs
   ```move
   // Example: This specific emergency fund bypasses normal rules
   set_object_policy(emergency_vault_id, MODE_DAO_ONLY)
   // Overrides TYPE policy for USDC and ACTION policy for SpendAction
   ```
   - Checked by extracting object IDs from BCS-serialized action data
   - Supported: Streams, Pools, Vaults, Files, any owned object
   - **Use case**: Emergency funds, high-value assets, critical infrastructure

**2. TYPE policies** (middle priority) - Coin types or capability types
   ```move
   // Example: Different rules per coin type
   set_type_policy<SpendAction<SUI>>(dao, none, MODE_DAO_ONLY)
   set_type_policy<SpendAction<USDC>>(dao, some(treasury_council), MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL)
   // SUI spending is easy, USDC needs Treasury Council oversight
   ```
   - Works for **31 parameterized actions** with type parameters
   - Detects `<CoinType>` in TypeName (e.g., `SpendAction<0x2::sui::SUI>`)
   - **Use case**: Different governance for different assets/pairs

**3. ACTION policies** (lowest priority) - Action types
   ```move
   // Example: Default policy for all spending
   set_action_policy<SpendAction>(dao, some(treasury_council), MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL)
   // Applies to ANY coin type unless overridden by TYPE or OBJECT
   ```
   - Fallback if no OBJECT/TYPE policy matches
   - Works for **all 145 actions**
   - **Use case**: Default governance rules

**4. FILE policies** - Treated as OBJECT policies (specific document IDs)
   ```move
   // Example: Legal documents need Legal Council
   set_object_policy(operating_agreement_id, some(legal_council), MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL)
   ```

**Code Location:** `futarchy_multisig/sources/policy/intent_spec_analyzer.move:120-242`

### Policy Hierarchy Example (Override in Action)

```move
// Setup: Three levels of policies
set_action_policy<SpendAction>(MODE_DAO_ONLY)                    // Level 3: Default is easy
set_type_policy<SpendAction<USDC>>(MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL)        // Level 2: USDC is strict
set_object_policy(emergency_vault_id, MODE_DAO_ONLY)            // Level 1: Emergency override

// Scenario 1: Spend SUI from regular vault
// No OBJECT policy ‚Üí No TYPE policy ‚Üí ACTION policy matches
// Result: MODE_DAO_ONLY (easy)

// Scenario 2: Spend USDC from regular vault
// No OBJECT policy ‚Üí TYPE policy matches (skip ACTION)
// Result: MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL (Treasury Council required)

// Scenario 3: Spend USDC from emergency vault
// OBJECT policy matches (skip TYPE and ACTION)
// Result: MODE_DAO_ONLY (emergency bypass, even for USDC!)
```

### Policy Modes

Each policy specifies an approval mode:

- **MODE_DAO_ONLY (0)**: Only DAO vote needed
- **MODE_COUNCIL_ONLY (1)**: Only specific council approval needed (no DAO vote)
  - Executed via **optimistic intents** (10-day challenge period)
  - Council creates intent on DAO account ‚Üí DAO can challenge ‚Üí Council executes
- **MODE_DAO_OR_COUNCIL (2)**: Either DAO vote OR council approval
- **MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL (3)**: **Both** DAO vote AND council pre-approval required
  - Council pre-approves via `ApprovedIntentSpec` ‚Üí DAO creates proposal ‚Üí DAO votes

### Two-Level Enforcement Timing (When Policies Are Checked)

Policies are enforced at **TWO different times** with different purposes:

#### 1. IntentSpec Level (Proposal Creation) - PRIMARY ENFORCEMENT ‚úÖ

**Location:** `governance_actions.move:467-521`

**What happens:**
```move
// When user creates proposal with IntentSpecs:
while (i < vector::length(&action.intent_specs)) {
    let intent_spec = vector::borrow(&action.intent_specs, i);

    // üîç LOOKUP current policy registry (OBJECT > TYPE > ACTION hierarchy)
    let requirement = intent_spec_analyzer::analyze_requirements_comprehensive(
        intent_spec,
        policy_reg  // ‚Üê Reads current policies from registry
    );

    let mode = intent_spec_analyzer::mode(&requirement);

    // üîí ENFORCE pre-approval requirement
    if (mode == 3) { // MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL
        assert!(has_approval, ECouncilApprovalRequired);  // ‚Üê FAILS HERE if no approval
    };

    // üíæ STORE policy data inline (lock it in)
    vector::push_back(&mut policy_modes, mode);
    vector::push_back(&mut required_council_ids, council_id_opt);
}
```

**Purpose:**
- **Primary enforcement** - Lookup current policies, enforce pre-approval
- **Policy lock-in** - Store requirements inline (won't change if registry changes later)
- **Spam prevention** - Reject proposals without required council approval

#### 2. Action Level (Execution) - DEFENSIVE VALIDATION ‚úÖ

**Location:** `governance_intents.move:180-188`

**What happens:**
```move
// When winning outcome executes (after market resolves):

// üìñ READ stored policy (not look up in registry!)
let policy_mode = proposal::get_policy_mode_for_outcome(proposal, outcome_index);
let council_approval_proof = proposal::get_council_approval_proof_for_outcome(proposal, outcome_index);

// ‚úÖ VALIDATE that requirements were met at creation
if (policy_mode == 3) { // MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL
    assert!(option::is_some(&council_approval_proof), 8); // Defensive check
};

// Then execute actions using the approved IntentSpec...
```

**Purpose:**
- **Defensive validation** - Verify locked-in requirements were satisfied
- **No registry lookup** - Uses policy data stored at creation time
- **Time-travel safe** - Policy changes don't affect in-flight proposals

**‚úÖ CHECKED:** Futarchy proposals only (via `analyze_requirements_comprehensive`)
- All intents MUST go through futarchy proposal system
- Move framework's `intents::new_intent()` is `public(package)` - can't be called externally

**‚ùå NOT CHECKED:** Direct Move framework intents (impossible to create externally)

### Proposal Creation Flow with Policies

```move
// 1. User creates proposal with IntentSpec
governance_actions::do_create_proposal(...)

// 2. Policy analysis in internal_fulfill_create_proposal()
let mut policy_modes = vector::empty<u8>();
let mut required_council_ids = vector::empty<Option<ID>>();
let mut council_approval_proofs = vector::empty<Option<ID>>();

while (i < vector::length(&action.intent_specs)) {
    let intent_spec = vector::borrow(&action.intent_specs, i);

    // Analyze OBJECT > TYPE > ACTION hierarchy
    let requirement = intent_spec_analyzer::analyze_requirements_comprehensive(
        intent_spec,
        policy_reg
    );

    let mode = intent_spec_analyzer::mode(&requirement);
    let council_id_opt = *intent_spec_analyzer::council_id(&requirement);

    // 3. If MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL (3), require pre-approval
    if (mode == 3) {
        assert!(has_approval, ECouncilApprovalRequired);
        approval_proof_opt = option::some(approval_id);
    };

    // 4. Store policy data INLINE (not in shared objects)
    vector::push_back(&mut policy_modes, mode);
    vector::push_back(&mut required_council_ids, council_id_opt);
    vector::push_back(&mut council_approval_proofs, approval_proof_opt);
};

// 5. Policy data stored inline in QueuedProposal and Proposal structs
// This "locks in" the policy - if DAO changes policies later,
// in-flight proposals use their original policy requirements
```

### Key Security Properties

1. **All actions go through proposals** - No direct intent creation bypasses
2. **Pre-approval enforced** - MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL requires council approval BEFORE market creation
3. **IntentSpec matching** - Approval must match proposed actions exactly (prevents substitution attacks)
4. **Override hierarchy** - Specific object policies override general type/action policies
5. **Policy lock-in** - Policy data stored inline at creation, immune to later policy changes
6. **Inline storage** - Simple, efficient (74 bytes per proposal vs 446 bytes with shared objects)

### Key Design Patterns (Why This System Is Beautiful)

#### 1. Policy Lock-In Pattern (Time-Travel Safe Governance)

**Problem:** What happens if the DAO changes policies while a proposal is in-flight?

**Solution:** Store policy data inline at creation time, not as references to registry.

```move
// Day 1: Create proposal under current rules
CreateProposalAction { ... }
‚Üí Policy lookup: MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL for USDC spending
‚Üí Store inline: policy_mode=3, required_council_id=treasury_council

// Day 30: DAO changes policy (via another proposal)
set_type_policy<SpendAction<USDC>>(MODE_DAO_ONLY)  // More permissive now

// Day 60: Original proposal wins
‚Üí Uses policy_mode=3 (locked in at creation)
‚Üí ‚úÖ Executes successfully (doesn't fail because policy changed)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Policy changes don't brick in-flight proposals (prevents governance gridlock)
- ‚úÖ Each proposal is self-contained (all data needed for execution stored inline)
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup (policy data deleted when proposal finalized)

**Storage:** 74 bytes inline vs 446 bytes + permanent storage for shared objects

---

#### 2. Three-Tier Hierarchy Pattern (Maximum Flexibility, Zero Conflicts)

**Problem:** How to support both specific overrides and general defaults without conflicts?

**Solution:** OBJECT > TYPE > ACTION hierarchy with first-match-wins semantics.

```move
// General default: Treasury spending needs approval
set_action_policy<SpendAction>(MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL)

// Override for specific asset: SUI is low-risk
set_type_policy<SpendAction<SUI>>(MODE_DAO_ONLY)

// Override for specific vault: Emergency fund bypasses all rules
set_object_policy(emergency_vault_id, MODE_DAO_ONLY)

// Result: Simple, predictable, no conflicts!
// Emergency vault > SUI type > General spending default
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ First match wins = No policy conflicts ever
- ‚úÖ Specific overrides general = Intuitive behavior
- ‚úÖ Works for all 145 actions = Universal pattern

---

#### 3. Pre-Approval Pattern (Spam Prevention)

**Problem:** Malicious users could spam proposals that will obviously fail council review.

**Solution:** Require council approval BEFORE creating futarchy market.

```move
// Without pre-approval (BAD):
User creates "Spend 1M USDC" proposal
‚Üí Market created, liquidity locked
‚Üí Treasury Council rejects
‚Üí Wasted gas/time, market spam

// With pre-approval (GOOD):
User requests "Spend 1M USDC"
‚Üí Treasury Council reviews FIRST
‚Üí Creates ApprovedIntentSpec if legitimate
‚Üí THEN proposal can enter queue
‚Üí No wasted markets for rejected proposals
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Prevents DoS via spam proposals
- ‚úÖ Council reviews before expensive market operations
- ‚úÖ Failed proposals never reach market phase

---

#### 4. Type-Level Policy Pattern (Compiler-Enforced Granularity)

**Problem:** Different assets/pairs need different governance rules.

**Solution:** Use Move's type parameters for zero-cost policy differentiation.

```move
// This is IMPOSSIBLE in Solidity/Rust without runtime dispatch
// Move's type system makes this a compile-time feature

set_type_policy<SpendAction<SUI>>(MODE_DAO_ONLY)         // Low risk
set_type_policy<SpendAction<USDC>>(MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL) // Treasury oversight
set_type_policy<SpendAction<BTC>>(MODE_COUNCIL_ONLY)     // Full delegation

// Compiler enforces type safety:
SpendAction<SUI> ‚â† SpendAction<USDC> (different TypeNames)
// Runtime lookup: O(1) TypeName comparison
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Zero-cost abstraction (compile-time type checking)
- ‚úÖ Works for 31 parameterized actions
- ‚úÖ Unique to Move (not possible in other blockchains)

---

#### 5. Inline Storage Pattern (Simplicity + Efficiency)

**Problem:** Shared PolicyRequirement objects create permanent storage bloat.

**Solution:** Store policy data directly in proposal structs.

```move
// OLD: Shared objects (446 bytes, permanent storage)
struct PolicyRequirement has key {
    id: UID,
    policy_mode: u8,
    required_council_id: Option<ID>,
    council_approval_proof: Option<ID>,
}

// NEW: Inline storage (74 bytes, auto-deleted)
struct Proposal {
    ...
    policy_mode: u8,                      // 1 byte
    required_council_id: Option<ID>,     // 33 bytes
    council_approval_proof: Option<ID>,  // 33 bytes
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ 83% size reduction (74 bytes vs 446 bytes)
- ‚úÖ Auto-cleanup (deleted when proposal finalized)
- ‚úÖ Simpler architecture (no shared object management)

---

#### 6. Two-Phase Security Pattern (Oracle Grants)

**Problem:** How to allow price-triggered minting without governance on every claim?

**Solution:** Separate authorization (governance) from execution (permissionless).

```move
// Phase 1: Grant Creation (FULL POLICY ENFORCEMENT)
CreateOracleGrantAction<SUI, USDC> { recipients, amounts, ... }
‚Üí Goes through governance proposal
‚Üí TYPE-level policy: "Different rules for SUI vs test tokens"
‚Üí DAO votes
‚Üí Creates PriceBasedMintGrant object (pre-authorized)

// Phase 2: Grant Claiming (NO POLICY - BY DESIGN)
claim_grant()
‚Üí Validate price/vesting/time conditions
‚Üí Borrow TreasuryCap from Account (no policy check)
‚Üí Mint (grant already approved via governance)
‚Üí Transfer to recipient
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Governance controls authorization (who can mint what)
- ‚úÖ Execution is permissionless (anyone can claim if conditions met)
- ‚úÖ No redundant policy checks on execution
- ‚úÖ Correct separation of concerns
**This is Type-Safe Futarchy Infrastructure** - a new governance primitive for decentralized organizations.

### Type-Level Policy Support (31 Parameterized Actions)

**Move Framework Actions (9):**

- Governance actions: `CreateProposalAction`, etc.
- Stream management (10+): `CancelStreamAction`, `PauseStreamAction`, `UpdateStreamAction`, etc.
- Security council actions (20+): `CouncilApproveIntentSpecAction`, `CreateSecurityCouncilAction`, etc.
- Protocol admin actions (25+): `UpdateDaoCreationFeeAction`, `ApproveVerificationAction`, etc.

```move
// Different rules for different coins
set_type_policy<SpendAction<SUI>>(dao, none, MODE_DAO_ONLY);
set_type_policy<SpendAction<USDC>>(dao, some(treasury_council), MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL);

// Different rules for different liquidity pairs
set_type_policy<CreatePoolAction<SUI, USDC>>(dao, some(liq_council), MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL);
set_type_policy<CreatePoolAction<ETH, DAI>>(dao, some(trading_council), MODE_COUNCIL_ONLY);

// Different rules for different grant types
set_type_policy<CreateOracleGrantAction<SUI, USDC>>(dao, some(treasury_council), MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL);
set_type_policy<CreateOracleGrantAction<TEST, USDC>>(dao, none, MODE_DAO_ONLY);
```

## Oracle Grant System: Two-Phase Security Model ‚úÖ CORRECT BY DESIGN

### Architecture Overview

Oracle grants use a **two-phase security model** where governance controls authorization but execution is permissionless.

### Phase 1: Grant Creation (FULL POLICY ENFORCEMENT) ‚úÖ

**Grant creation goes through the full governance proposal system:**

```move
// In oracle_actions.move:1412
public struct CreateOracleGrantAction<phantom AssetType, phantom StableType> has store, drop, copy {
    recipients: vector<address>,
    amounts: vector<u64>,
    vesting_cliff_months: u64,
    strike_price: u64,
    price_condition_mode: u8,
    // ... all grant parameters
}
```

**Policy Enforcement at Grant Creation:**
- ‚úÖ **ACTION-level policy**: "Creating any oracle grants needs approval"
- ‚úÖ **TYPE-level policy**: "Creating SUI grants vs USDC grants = different policies"
  ```move
  // Example: Different policies per coin type
  set_type_policy<CreateOracleGrantAction<SUI, USDC>>(
      dao, some(treasury_council), MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL
  );
  set_type_policy<CreateOracleGrantAction<TEST, USDC>>(
      dao, none, MODE_DAO_ONLY
  );
  ```

**Grant Creation Flow:**
```
Propose CreateOracleGrantAction<SUI, USDC>
    ‚Üì
Policy Analysis (OBJECT > TYPE > ACTION hierarchy)
    ‚Üì
Council Pre-Approval (if MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL)
    ‚Üì
Futarchy Market Created
    ‚Üì
DAO Vote
    ‚Üì
Execute: Creates PriceBasedMintGrant<SUI, USDC> object
```

**Result:** Grant object is **pre-approved by governance** to mint specific amounts under specific conditions.

### Phase 2: Grant Claiming (NO POLICY ENFORCEMENT) ‚úÖ INTENTIONAL

**Grant claiming is permissionless - anyone with valid grant can claim:**

```move
// Step 1: Validate claim (line 945)
public fun claim_grant<AssetType, StableType>(
    grant: &mut PriceBasedMintGrant<AssetType, StableType>,
    claim_cap: &GrantClaimCap,
    spot_pool: &SpotAMM<AssetType, StableType>,
    conditional_pools: &vector<LiquidityPool>,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
): ResourceRequest<ClaimGrantAction> {  // ‚Üê Non-parameterized action
    // Validates:
    // - Price conditions met (via TWAP oracle)
    // - Vesting schedule satisfied
    // - Time bounds respected
    // - Grant not canceled/paused/frozen
    // Returns hot potato with validated claim data
}

// Step 2: Fulfill claim (line 1156)
public fun fulfill_claim_grant_from_account<AssetType, StableType, Config>(
    request: ResourceRequest<ClaimGrantAction>,  // ‚Üê Non-parameterized
    account: &mut Account<Config>,
    payment_coin: Coin<StableType>,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    // Borrow TreasuryCap from Account's managed assets (dynamic field access)
    let treasury_cap = currency::borrow_treasury_cap_mut<Config, AssetType>(account);

    // Mint tokens (grant already approved via governance)
    let minted_coin = coin::mint<AssetType>(treasury_cap, action.claimable_amount, ctx);

    // Transfer to recipient
    transfer::public_transfer(minted_coin, action.recipient);
}
```

**Why ClaimGrantAction is Non-Parameterized:**
1. **Grant object contains all type info** - `PriceBasedMintGrant<AssetType, StableType>`
2. **Type safety via generics** - `fulfill_claim_grant_from_account<AssetType, StableType, Config>`
3. **No policy needed** - Grant creation already went through governance
4. **Simpler hot potato** - No need to carry type parameters through ResourceRequest

**Why TreasuryCap is Borrowed (Not Passed as Parameter):**
- ‚úÖ **No object-level policy check** - Borrowing from Account's managed assets is dynamic field access
- ‚úÖ **Matches vault spending pattern** - Same as `vault.move::do_spend`
- ‚úÖ **Grant already approved** - Governance approved the mint authorization

### Security Model Comparison

| Phase | Policy Enforcement | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Grant Creation** | ‚úÖ Full (ACTION + TYPE) | Governance must approve WHO can create WHAT grants |
| **Grant Claiming** | ‚ùå None (by design) | Grant already approved; claiming is just execution |

**This is CORRECT security design:**
- Governance controls **authorization** (creating grants)
- Execution is **permissionless** (anyone with valid grant can claim)
- No redundant policy checks every time someone claims

### Two-Phase Flow Diagram

```move
// ‚úÖ Phase 1: Create grant via governance proposal
CreateOracleGrantAction<SUI, USDC> { recipients: [alice], amounts: [1000000], ... }
    ‚Üí Governance proposal
    ‚Üí Policy check (TYPE-level: CreateOracleGrantAction<SUI, USDC>)
    ‚Üí Council pre-approval if MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL
    ‚Üí DAO vote
    ‚Üí Creates PriceBasedMintGrant object

// ‚úÖ Phase 2: Alice claims grant (permissionless)
let request = claim_grant(grant, claim_cap, pool, ...);  // Validates price/vesting/time
fulfill_claim_grant_from_account<SUI, USDC>(request, dao_account, payment, ...);
    ‚Üí Borrows TreasuryCap from Account's managed assets
    ‚Üí Mints tokens (grant already approved)
    ‚Üí NO policy check (by design)
```

### Key Insight: When to Use Parameterized vs Non-Parameterized Actions

**Use Parameterized Actions When:**
- Policy differentiation needed (e.g., SUI vs USDC spending)
- Example: `SpendAction<CoinType>`, `CreateOracleGrantAction<AssetType, StableType>`

**Use Non-Parameterized Actions When:**
- Executing pre-approved operations (e.g., claiming grants)
- Type safety via generics on execution functions
- Example: `ClaimGrantAction` (non-parameterized) + `fulfill_claim_grant_from_account<AssetType, StableType>` (parameterized function)

## Common Build Issues

### Package Address Mismatches
**Issue**: "Conflicting assignments for address" errors during build
**Cause**: Package's own Move.toml has `package_name = "0x0"` while dependencies reference the deployed address
**Fix**: Ensure each package's Move.toml has its own address set to the deployed value, not "0x0"

## Frontend Control
**IMPORTANT**: The frontend and database are fully controlled by us. This means:
- We can track all proposal types and required resources in our database
- Frontend can determine exact type parameters needed for each proposal
- We can pass all required resources as parameters without needing dynamic dispatch
- Type parameters can be specified at the frontend/transaction building layer

This eliminates the need for complex type-erased patterns or string-based dispatch in Move contracts.

## Move Framework Location
The Account Protocol and Move framework this project builds on is located at:
`/Users/admin/monorepo/contracts/move-framework/`

Key directories:
- `/contracts/move-framework/packages/protocol/` - Core Account Protocol
- `/contracts/move-framework/packages/actions/` - Account actions (vault, currency, etc.)
- `/contracts/move-framework/packages/extensions/` - Protocol extensions

## CRITICAL: BCS Serialization Architecture (DO NOT REMOVE!)

**This fork uses BCS serialization for ALL actions - this is INTENTIONAL and REQUIRED.**

### Why BCS Serialization is Necessary:

1. **Pre-DAO Action Storage**: Actions must be staged BEFORE the DAO/Account exists
   - Fundraising phase stores `InitActionSpecs` (TypeName + BCS bytes) in Raise
   - Proposals store `ProposalIntentSpec` before execution
   - Can't use live action structs - no Intent/Account exists yet!

2. **Type-Safe Routing**: Uses `TypeName` for compile-time safety without live objects
   ```move
   ActionSpec {
       action_type: type_name::with_defining_ids<CreateCouncilAction>(),
       action_data: bcs::to_bytes(&action)  // ‚Üê Must serialize for storage
   }
   ```

3. **Deferred Execution Pattern**:
   ```
   FUNDRAISING ‚Üí Store ActionSpec (bytes) ‚Üí DAO CREATION ‚Üí Deserialize ‚Üí Build Intent ‚Üí Execute
   ```

### Implementation Details:

- **Protocol layer**: `add_typed_action(action_type: TypeName, action_data: vector<u8>)`
- **All 13+ action types**: Use serialize-then-destroy pattern
- **Security**: `bcs_validation.move` prevents trailing data attacks
- **Versioning**: ActionSpec has version field for migrations

### DO NOT switch to "direct storage" approach:
- ‚ùå Direct storage requires live Intent (can't store actions before DAO exists)
- ‚ùå Would break futarchy factory init action staging
- ‚ùå Would break proposal intent spec storage
- ‚úÖ BCS serialization enables pre-DAO action specifications

## CRITICAL: Hanson-Style Futarchy with Quantum Liquidity

This is a **Hanson-style futarchy implementation** where liquidity exists quantum-mechanically across multiple conditional markets simultaneously.

### Core Mechanism

**Quantum Liquidity Splitting:**
- 1 spot token ‚Üí 1 conditional token for EACH outcome (not proportional division)
- Example: $100 spot becomes $100 in YES market AND $100 in NO market simultaneously
- Only the highest-priced conditional market wins; its tokens become redeemable 1:1

**During Active Proposals:**
- Spot AMM is COMPLETELY EMPTY (all liquidity in conditionals)
- Price discovery happens across parallel conditional AMMs
- TWAP must aggregate from ALL conditional markets, using highest price

### Why This Architecture Matters

1. **Write-Through Oracle Pattern Required**
   - `get_twap()` MUST call `write_observation()` before reading in same transaction
   - Prevents stale price attacks in quantum liquidity model
   - See: `/contracts/futarchy/sources/markets/oracle.move:473-492`

2. **Security Implications**
   - Price manipulation requires attacking ALL conditional markets simultaneously
   - Standard oracle patterns will fail - liquidity is quantum, not classical
   - Empty spot pools during proposals is intentional, not a bug

### Common Misconceptions

| Wrong Assumption | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| Liquidity splits proportionally | Exists fully in ALL outcomes simultaneously |
| Standard oracles work | Must handle quantum liquidity + empty spot |
| Spot price exists during proposals | Only conditional prices exist |

## Design Philosophy: Ephemeral DAOs

Futarchy DAOs are **designed to dissolve** when markets signal they're no longer creating value (price < NAV).

### Key Features

**1. Native Dissolution**
- Market-driven shutdown when price < NAV
- Clean capital return to holders
- Creates natural price floor at NAV

**2. Streaming Payments**
- Continuous operations without discrete treasury votes
- Instant cancellation during dissolution
- No large withdrawals affecting price

**3. Cross-DAO Coordination (M-of-N)**
- Example: 3-of-5 DAOs approve shared infrastructure
- Weighted voting (parent DAO 51%, subsidiaries 49%)
- Atomic all-or-nothing execution

### Lifecycle

```
CREATION ‚Üí OPERATION ‚Üí EVALUATION ‚Üí [DISSOLUTION if price < NAV]
         ‚Üë                        ‚Üì
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Continue if price > NAV
```

## DAO Creation & Init Actions

### How DAO Bootstrapping Works

DAOs are created and initialized using PTB composition with hot potato pattern for atomicity:

```typescript
// PTB composes init actions directly - no central dispatcher
const [account, queue, pool] = tx.moveCall({
  target: 'factory::create_dao_unshared',  // Returns unshared hot potatoes
  ...
});

// Each module exposes its own init functions
tx.moveCall({
  target: 'operating_agreement::init_create_operating_agreement',
  arguments: [account, lines, difficulties, ...]
});

tx.moveCall({
  target: 'stream_actions::init_create_stream',
  arguments: [account, recipient, amount, ...]
});

tx.moveCall({
  target: 'account_spot_pool::init_add_liquidity',
  arguments: [assetCoin, stableCoin, pool]
});

// Must finalize to share objects (hot potato consumed)
tx.moveCall({
  target: 'factory::finalize_and_share_dao',
  arguments: [account, queue, pool]
});
```

**Key Points:**
- **No Serialization**: PTBs call entry functions directly (no ActionSpec needed for init)
- **Module Ownership**: Each module (operating_agreement, stream_actions, etc.) owns its init functions
- **Atomic Guarantee**: Hot potatoes ensure all-or-nothing execution
- **Extensible**: Any module can add `init_*` entry functions without modifying core

**Share Functions Added:**
- `account::share_account()`
- `priority_queue::share_queue()`
- `account_spot_pool::share_pool()`

These are required because Sui only allows `share_object` in the module that defines the type.

## PTB-Driven Intent Architecture

### Core Components & Their Roles

#### 1. IntentSpec (The Blueprint)
- **What**: Lightweight, immutable specification of actions to be executed
- **Where**: Stored in Proposals and used during DAO initialization
- **Structure**:
  - `ProposalIntentSpec` (no UID) for storage in proposals
  - `account_protocol::IntentSpec` (with UID) for execution
- **Purpose**: Defines WHAT actions will be executed before they're approved
- **Key Point**: Never executed directly - must be converted to Intent/Executable first

#### 2. Intent (The Live Contract)
- **What**: Stateful object representing approved, executable actions
- **Where**: Stored in Account's intents bag after approval
- **Purpose**: Represents recurring or scheduled actions that persist
- **Lifecycle**: Created from IntentSpec ‚Üí Lives in Account ‚Üí Executed via Executable

#### 3. PTB as Dispatcher (The Orchestrator)
- **What**: Programmable Transaction Blocks act as the primary dispatcher
- **How**: Chain multiple entry functions in a single atomic transaction
- **Pattern**:
  ```
  1. execute_proposal() ‚Üí creates Executable hot potato
  2. execute_config_actions() ‚Üí processes config actions
  3. execute_liquidity_actions() ‚Üí processes liquidity actions
  4. execute_finalize() ‚Üí confirms execution
  ```
- **Benefit**: Composable, flexible, no monolithic on-chain dispatcher needed

#### 4. Init Actions (DAO Creation)
- **What**: Special pattern for atomic DAO initialization
- **How**: Uses hot potato pattern with unshared objects
- **Pattern**:
  ```
  1. create_dao_unshared() ‚Üí returns Account, Queue, AMM as hot potatoes
  2. execute_init_config() ‚Üí applies config actions
  3. execute_init_liquidity() ‚Üí sets up liquidity
  4. finalize_and_share_dao() ‚Üí shares objects publicly
  ```

### Type-Based Action Routing

**Old System** (String-based):
- Used `action_descriptor` with string categories like `b"treasury"`
- Runtime string comparison for routing
- Prone to typos and runtime errors

**New System** (TypeName-based):
- Uses `type_name::get<action_types::UpdateName>()` for compile-time safety
- O(1) type comparison at runtime
- Action types defined in `futarchy_utils::action_types`
- Zero-cost abstraction with maximum safety

## Action Descriptor & Approval System

### Why Descriptors in Move Framework?

The system uses `ActionDescriptor` in the base Move Framework (not Futarchy packages) because:

1. **Permissionless enforcement** - Anyone can create intents directly with Move Framework actions. If descriptors were only at the Futarchy layer, malicious actors could bypass approval requirements by calling base actions directly.

2. **Clean layering without circular dependencies**:
   - **Protocol layer** (Move Framework): Stores descriptors as `vector<u8>` - pure structure, no semantics
   - **Application layer** (Futarchy): Interprets bytes, defines policies - semantics without modifying structure

3. **Extensible** - Other projects can use different descriptor categories without modifying base protocol

### Architecture

```move
// In Move Framework - generic bytes, no futarchy concepts
struct ActionDescriptor {
    category: vector<u8>,    // e.g., b"treasury", b"governance"
    action_type: vector<u8>, // e.g., b"spend", b"update_config"
    target_object: Option<ID>,
}

// In Futarchy - interprets bytes, defines approval rules
struct PolicyRegistry {
    pattern_policies: Table<vector<u8>, PolicyRule>,  // b"treasury/spend" -> Treasury Council
    object_policies: Table<ID, PolicyRule>,           // Specific UpgradeCap -> Technical Council
}
```

### Approval Modes

- `MODE_DAO_ONLY (0)`: Only DAO approval needed
- `MODE_COUNCIL_ONLY (1)`: Only specified council approval needed
- `MODE_DAO_OR_COUNCIL (2)`: Either DAO or council can approve
- `MODE_DAO_AND_COUNCIL (3)`: Both DAO and council must approve

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Every action has descriptors** - All Move Framework and Futarchy actions include descriptors for governance
2. **Parallel vectors in Intent** - `actions: vector<vector<u8>>` and `action_descriptors: vector<ActionDescriptor>` stay in sync
3. **vector<u8> not enums** - Avoids circular dependencies; futarchy defines meaning of bytes
4. **Multi-council support** - DAOs can have Treasury, Technical, Legal, Emergency councils with different responsibilities

## Architecture Overview

Built as a **governance layer** on Account Protocol framework:
- **Futarchy**: Handles governance and market-based decisions
- **Account Protocol**: Manages assets, vaults, and permissions
- **Action Dispatcher**: Routes approved proposals to handlers

### Core Components

**FutarchyConfig** (`dao/core/futarchy_config.move`)
- Creates typed `Account<FutarchyConfig>` for DAOs
- Stores trading params, governance settings, metadata

**Action Dispatcher** (`dao/core/action_dispatcher.move`)
- Hot potato pattern - `Executable` must be consumed
- Routes to action handlers, executes sequentially

**Proposal States** (`dao/governance/proposal.move`)
- `PENDING` ‚Üí `TRADING` ‚Üí `PASSED/FAILED` ‚Üí `EXECUTED`

### Action System

**Futarchy-Specific Actions:**
- Config: `SetProposalsEnabled`, `UpdateName`, trading params
- Dissolution: `InitiateDissolution`, `DistributeAsset`, `FinalizeDissolution`
- Liquidity: Pool creation/management for AMMs
- Streams: Recurring payments with instant cancellation
- Operating Agreement: On-chain legal document management

**Delegated to Account Protocol:**
```move
// Transfers
vault_intents::request_spend_and_transfer<Config, Outcome, CoinType>(...)

// Minting
currency_intents::request_mint_and_transfer<Config, Outcome, CoinType>(...)

// Burning
currency_intents::request_withdraw_and_burn<Config, Outcome, CoinType>(...)
```

### Security Model

Access control hierarchy:
1. `ConfigWitness` - Only `futarchy_config` module can create
2. `Auth` - Via `futarchy_config::authenticate()`
3. `IntentWitness` - Validates action sequence
4. Hot potato ensures atomic execution (no partial proposals)

## Action System & Dispatcher

### Complete Action System Overview

The Futarchy DAO inherits a comprehensive set of actions from the Account Protocol Move framework and adds futarchy-specific governance on top. This provides a complete, production-ready action system.

### Inherited Actions from Account Protocol

**Currency Module** (`currency.move`):
- `request_withdraw_and_burn` - Token burning from treasury
- `request_mint_and_transfer` - Token minting with transfer
- `request_mint_and_vest` - Token minting with vesting schedules
- `request_update_metadata` - Update coin metadata
- `request_disable_rules` - Disable currency permission rules

**Vault Module** (`vault.move`):
- `request_spend_and_transfer` - Direct treasury spending
- `request_spend_and_vest` - Treasury spending with vesting

**Owned Module** (`owned.move`):
- `request_withdraw_and_transfer` - Generic object transfers
- `request_withdraw_and_vest` - Create vesting from owned objects
- `request_withdraw_and_transfer_to_vault` - Move objects to vault

**Package Upgrade** (`package_upgrade.move`):
- `request_upgrade_package` - Contract upgrades
- `request_restrict_policy` - Upgrade policy management

**Access Control** (`access_control.move`):
- `request_borrow_cap` - Capability borrowing for privileged operations

**Kiosk** (`kiosk.move`):
- `request_take_nfts` - NFT transfers from kiosk
- `request_list_nfts` - NFT marketplace listing

### Futarchy-Specific Actions

**Config Actions** - DAO parameter management:
- Proposals enable/disable, trading params, metadata, TWAP config
- Governance settings, queue params, slash distribution

**Oracle Actions** - Price-based automation:
- `ReadOraclePriceAction` - Oracle price reading
- `ConditionalMintAction` - Price-triggered minting
- `TieredMintAction` - Multi-tier vesting (founder rewards)

**Dissolution Actions** - Clean shutdown:
- Initiate/cancel dissolution, asset distribution
- Stream cancellation, AMM withdrawal

**Stream Actions** - Payment systems:
- Budget streams with accountability
- Cliff periods and cancellable payments
- Multi-withdrawer project funding

**Operating Agreement** - On-chain legal framework:
- Line management, immutability controls
- Batch modifications

**Liquidity Actions** - AMM management:
- Pool creation, parameter updates
- Liquidity add/remove operations

**Governance Actions** - Meta-governance:
- Second-order proposal creation
- Proposal reservation for evicted proposals

### Action Dispatcher Architecture

The `action_dispatcher` module provides central routing with specialized execution functions:

```move
execute_standard_actions     // Config, memos, operating agreement
execute_vault_spend          // Treasury operations (inherited)
execute_vault_management     // Coin type management (inherited)
execute_oracle_mint         // Oracle-based minting (hot potato)
execute_liquidity_operations // AMM management
execute_stream_operations   // Payment streams
execute_dissolution_operations // Shutdown coordination
execute_governance_operations // Second-order proposals
```

### Hot Potato Pattern Usage

**Direct Execution** (no hot potato):
- **Config actions** - Modify DAO settings already in Account
- **Memo actions** - Just emit events
- **Operating Agreement** - Text management
- **Dissolution actions** - Use resources already in Account
- **Stream actions** - Use resources already in Account
- **Inherited vault intents** - Account Protocol handles resources

**Hot Potato Pattern** (return ResourceRequest):
- **Oracle/Mint actions** - Need external `TreasuryCap` for minting
- **Governance actions** - Need shared objects (`ProposalQueue`, `FeeManager`)
- **Liquidity actions** - Need external AMM pools

The distinction exists because Move's ownership model prevents storing certain resources (TreasuryCaps, Coins, shared objects) in the Account permanently. Actions that need these resources use the hot potato pattern to get them just-in-time from the caller.

### Standard Action Pattern
All actions follow a consistent pattern with `do_` functions that take only standard parameters:

```move
public fun do_action_name<Outcome: store, IW: drop>(
    executable: &mut Executable<Outcome>,
    account: &mut Account<FutarchyConfig>,
    version: VersionWitness,
    witness: IW,
    clock: &Clock,  // if needed
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

### Hot Potato Pattern for Special Resources
Actions needing special resources use the **hot potato pattern**:

1. **Action creates ResourceRequest** (no abilities - must consume):
   ```move
   public fun do_create_proposal<Outcome: store, IW: drop>(
       ...standard params...
   ): ResourceRequest<CreateProposalAction>
   ```

2. **Caller must fulfill in same transaction**:
   ```move
   public fun fulfill_create_proposal(
       request: ResourceRequest<CreateProposalAction>,
       queue: &mut ProposalQueue,
       fee_manager: &mut ProposalFeeManager,
       registry: &mut ProposalReservationRegistry,
       fee_coin: Coin<SUI>,
       clock: &Clock,
       ctx: &mut TxContext,
   ): ResourceReceipt<CreateProposalAction>
   ```

### Production Readiness

The action system is **100% production-ready** with:
- ‚úÖ Complete token operations (mint, burn, vest)
- ‚úÖ Full treasury management (spend, multi-asset)
- ‚úÖ Package upgrades and migrations
- ‚úÖ Emergency controls and risk management
- ‚úÖ Advanced features (streams, cross-DAO, oracle automation)

The architecture correctly:
- Inherits standard operations from Account Protocol
- Adds futarchy-specific logic on top
- Delegates to proven framework code
- Maintains clean separation of concerns

## Architecture Summary: Composable Governance Actions

Our system uses a dual-pattern architecture that cleanly separates the construction of actions from their execution. This design leverages the full power of Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs) for maximum composability and security.

### 1. Core Data Structures

**ActionSpec (The Blueprint)**
- Data Structure: `struct { action_type: TypeName, action_data: vector<u8> }`
- Role: A lightweight, immutable, serializable description of a single action. It is a plan, not a live object.
- Used For: Staging actions for DAO initialization and for defining the payload of on-chain governance proposals.

**IntentSpec (The Blueprint Collection)**
- Data Structure: `struct { actions: vector<ActionSpec>, ... }`
- Role: A container for a list of ActionSpec blueprints. It represents the complete set of actions for an init sequence or a proposal outcome.

**Intent (The Live Contract)**
- Data Structure: `struct { actions: Bag, ... }`
- Role: A stateful object stored inside a live Account. It represents an approved, executable plan or a recurring task. It is not used for unapproved proposals to avoid state bloat.

**Executable (The Hot Potato)**
- Data Structure: A hot potato struct that wraps a temporary Intent.
- Role: Securely passes the right to execute a sequence of actions between functions within a single atomic transaction. It cannot be stored or transferred across transaction boundaries.

### 2. The Two-Phase Lifecycle

**Phase A: Construction (Building the IntentSpec Blueprint)**
- How it's Called: Off-chain clients (SDKs, UIs) build a PTB.
- Dispatcher: The PTB acts as a "Builder Dispatcher."
- On-Chain Method: The PTB calls a single, centralized entry function: `init_intent_builder::build_spec(action_id, params_bcs)`.
  - This on-chain builder function uses an if/else chain on action_id to deserialize the params_bcs into a strongly-typed action data struct.
  - It then creates and returns a validated ActionSpec.
- Result: The PTB assembles a list of ActionSpecs to create a complete IntentSpec object on-chain.

**Phase B: Execution (Processing the Executable Hot Potato)**
- How it's Called: An approved proposal or init sequence kicks off the execution flow. A top-level entry function reads an IntentSpec and converts it into an Executable hot potato, which is then passed through a chain of calls in a PTB.
- Dispatcher: The PTB acts as the "Execution Dispatcher." There is no central on-chain main_dispatcher.
- On-Chain Method: The PTB calls a series of modular, category-specific entry functions (e.g., `config_dispatcher::execute_config_actions`, `liquidity_dispatcher::execute_liquidity_actions`).
  - Each of these functions accepts the Executable hot potato, processes all actions relevant to its category in a loop, and then passes the updated hot potato on to the next call in the PTB.
  - Each function has a unique signature, allowing the PTB to provide the specific resources (`&mut SpotAMM`, `Coin<T>`, etc.) that it needs.
- Finalization: The last call in the PTB is to a `confirm_and_cleanup` function that consumes the final Executable, ensuring the process is completed atomically and securely.

## Quick Start

### When to Deploy

Run the deployment script when:
- **First time setup** - No packages have been deployed yet
- **After code changes** - You've modified any Move code
- **Network switch** - Moving from devnet to testnet/mainnet
- **Fresh deployment needed** - Starting over with clean addresses

### How to Deploy

```bash
# Deploy all 13 packages with one command
./deploy_verified.sh

# This will:
# 1. Request gas from faucet automatically
# 2. Deploy all 13 packages in correct dependency order
# 3. Update all Move.toml files with new addresses
# 4. Save deployment results to deployment-logs/ folder
```

### Pre-deployment Checklist

1. **Check network**: `sui client active-env`
2. **Switch if needed**: `sui client switch --env testnet`
3. **Reset addresses** (for fresh deploy):
   ```bash
   find . -name "Move.toml" -exec sed -i '' 's/= "0x[a-f0-9]*"/= "0x0"/' {} \;
   ```
4. **Run deployment**: `./deploy_verified.sh`

## Overview

The Futarchy protocol consists of 13 interdependent packages that must be deployed in a specific order. The deployment script (`deploy_verified.sh`) handles all dependencies, address updates, and verification automatically.

**Important**: Always use the deployment script rather than deploying manually. The script ensures correct order and updates all cross-package references.

## Deployment Script Details

### Main Script: `deploy_verified.sh`

This script handles the complete deployment process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Key features:
# - Requests gas from faucet automatically
# - Deploys packages in correct dependency order
# - Updates all Move.toml files with new addresses
# - Saves deployment results to JSON
# - Shows clear success/failure status for each package
```

### Important Flags

#### For `sui move build`:
```bash
sui move build --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
```
- `--skip-fetch-latest-git-deps`: Skip fetching latest git dependencies
- Note: `--skip-dependency-verification` is NOT a valid flag for build

#### For `sui client publish`:
```bash
sui client publish --gas-budget 5000000000 --skip-dependency-verification
```
- `--gas-budget 5000000000`: Set gas budget to 5 SUI
- `--skip-dependency-verification`: Skip verifying dependency source matches on-chain bytecode
- Note: As of recent Sui versions, dependency verification is disabled by default

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Move.toml Configuration Issues

**Problem**: "address with no value" error during build
**Solution**: Each package must have its own address defined:

```toml
[addresses]
package_name = "0x0"  # Set to 0x0 before deployment
# ... other dependencies with their deployed addresses
```

### 2. Incorrect Flag Usage

**Problem**: `error: unexpected argument '--skip-dependency-verification' found` during build
**Cause**: This flag only works with `sui client publish`, not `sui move build`
**Solution**: Use `--skip-fetch-latest-git-deps` for build commands

### 3. Package ID Extraction

**Problem**: Script reports success but packages aren't deployed
**Cause**: Package ID not extracted correctly from output
**Solution**: The script now correctly extracts from this pattern:
```
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ PackageID: 0x...                                          ‚îÇ
```

### 4. Gas Issues

**Problem**: Insufficient gas for deployment
**Solution**: Script automatically requests from faucet, but you can manually request:
```bash
sui client faucet
```

## Manual Deployment Steps

If you need to deploy packages manually:

### 1. Check Prerequisites

```bash
# Check gas balance (need at least 10 SUI)
sui client gas

# Request gas if needed
sui client faucet

# Check active network
sui client active-env
```

### 2. Deploy a Single Package

```bash
# Navigate to package directory
cd /path/to/package

## Deployment Script Features

The `deploy_verified.sh` script provides:

- **Automatic gas management** - Requests from faucet if needed
- **Correct flag usage** - Uses proper flags for build vs publish
- **Package ID extraction** - Correctly parses deployment output
- **Address updates** - Updates all Move.toml files automatically
- **Progress tracking** - Shows clear status for each package
- **Error handling** - Stops on failure with clear error messages
- **Results saving** - Saves deployment addresses to JSON file
- **Deployment log** - Complete log of deployment process

## Testing

```bash
sui move test --silence-warnings
sui move build --silence-warnings
```

### Test Coverage Analysis

To analyze test coverage for Move modules, use the custom-built `sui-tracing` binary which provides coverage instrumentation:

**Location**: `~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui`

#### Running Tests with Coverage

```bash
# Run tests with coverage tracking
~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move test --coverage

# This generates:
# - .coverage_map.mvcov - Binary coverage data
# - Coverage traces in memory
```

#### Viewing Coverage Reports

**1. Summary View** - Overall module coverage percentages:
```bash
~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move coverage summary
```

**2. Source Code View** - See covered/uncovered lines (with colors):
```bash
~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move coverage source --module <module_name>
```

**3. Bytecode View** - See covered/uncovered instructions:
```bash
~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move coverage bytecode --module <module_name>
```

#### Extracting Uncovered Lines

The coverage tools output ANSI color codes:
- **Green (`\x1b[32m`)** = Covered lines
- **Red (`\x1b[1;31m`)** = Uncovered lines

**Script to Extract Uncovered Lines:**

```bash
# Save coverage with colors preserved
script -q /dev/null ~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move coverage source --module <module_name> 2>&1 | cat > /tmp/coverage.txt

# Extract uncovered (red) lines
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import re

with open('/tmp/coverage.txt', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read().decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')

print("="*70)
print("UNCOVERED LINES")
print("="*70)

for line in data.split('\n'):
    # Check for red color code (uncovered)
    if '\x1b[1;31m' in line:
        # Remove ANSI codes for display
        clean = re.sub(r'\x1b\[[0-9;]*m', '', line)
        print(clean)
PYEOF
```

**Bytecode Uncovered Instructions:**

```bash
# Extract uncovered bytecode instructions
~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move coverage bytecode --module <module_name> 2>&1 | \
  sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g' | \
  awk '/^public|^entry/{print "\n" $0} /^\t[0-9]+:/{print "  UNCOVERED: " $0}'
```

#### Example: Math Module Coverage

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move test --coverage

# View summary
~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move coverage summary
# Output: math module = 95.51% coverage

# Extract uncovered lines
script -q /dev/null ~/sui-tracing/target/release/sui move coverage source --module math 2>&1 | cat > /tmp/math_cov.txt
# Parse /tmp/math_cov.txt for red lines (\x1b[1;31m)

# Result: 7 uncovered lines (all error assertions)
# - assert!(c != 0, EDivideByZero)
# - assert!(result <= max_value, EOverflow)
# etc.
```

#### Understanding Coverage Gaps

- **Source level**: Uncovered lines are typically error handling code (assertions, aborts)
- **Bytecode level**: Uncovered instructions are abort paths that tests don't trigger
- **95%+ coverage**: Usually means all happy paths tested, error paths not tested
- **100% coverage**: Requires tests that intentionally trigger errors (overflow, divide-by-zero, etc.)

## Key Implementation Notes

- Write-through oracle is MANDATORY due to quantum liquidity
- TWAP aggregates from multiple simultaneous conditional markets
- Historical price stitching required when liquidity returns to spot
- Actions need `ConfigWitness` for proper access control
- 70% less code by delegating to Account Protocol

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check gas balance**: Ensure you have sufficient SUI
2. **Verify network**: Confirm you're on the correct network
3. **Check dependencies**: Ensure all dependency packages exist
4. **Review logs**: Check the deployment log for specific errors
5. **Reset addresses**: Set package addresses to 0x0 and retry

### Reset all addresses for fresh deployment:

```bash
# Reset all package addresses to 0x0
find . -name "Move.toml" -exec sed -i '' \
  's/= "0x[a-f0-9]*"/= "0x0"/' {} \;
```

### Clean duplicate entries in Move.toml:

```bash
# Remove duplicate lines from Move.toml files
find . -name "Move.toml" | while read file; do
    awk '!seen[$0]++' "$file" > "$file.tmp" && mv "$file.tmp" "$file"
done
```

## Environment Paths

The deployment scripts use these paths:
- **Contracts root**: `/Users/admin/monorepo/contracts`
- **Move framework**: `/Users/admin/monorepo/contracts/move-framework`
- **Kiosk**: `/Users/admin/monorepo/contracts/move-framework/deps/kiosk`
- **Futarchy packages**: `/Users/admin/monorepo/contracts/futarchy_*`

## Best Practices

1. **Always deploy in order** - Dependencies must exist before dependents
2. **Use the script** - Manual deployment is error-prone
3. **Save deployment info** - Keep the JSON output for reference
4. **Check gas first** - Ensure sufficient balance before starting
5. **Verify deployment** - Check that packages exist after deployment
6. **Use correct flags** - Different flags for build vs publish commands

## Support

If deployment fails:
1. Check the deployment log for specific errors
2. Verify all dependencies are correctly deployed
3. Ensure Move.toml files don't have duplicate entries
4. Confirm sufficient gas balance
5. Try resetting addresses and deploying fresh

The `deploy_verified.sh` script handles most edge cases automatically and provides clear error messages to help debug any issues.

## ExecutionContext Removal & PTB Architecture

### Key Changes Made (2025-09-18)
- **Removed ExecutionContext** entirely - PTBs handle object flow naturally
- **Removed placeholder system** - Use direct IDs instead of indices
- **Kept ResourceRequest pattern** - Valid for external resources (hot potato)

### Architecture Decisions

#### What Was Removed
1. **ExecutionContext** - Unnecessary complexity, PTBs handle object flow
2. **Placeholder system** - `placeholder_in/placeholder_out` fields removed
3. **ActionResults** - No longer needed without ExecutionContext
4. **resolve_placeholder()** calls - Function never existed

#### What Was Kept
1. **ResourceRequest pattern** - For actions needing external resources (AMMs, shared objects)
2. **IntentSpec** - Blueprint for proposals and DAO initialization
3. **Direct ID passing** - All actions use explicit IDs

### Pattern Guidelines

**Good Pattern - Direct Execution:**
```move
public fun do_action(
    executable: &mut Executable<Outcome>,
    account: &mut Account<Config>,
    pool_id: ID,  // Direct ID, no placeholders
)
```

**Good Pattern - ResourceRequest for External Resources:**
```move
// When action needs resources not in Account
public fun do_create_pool(...): ResourceRequest<CreatePoolAction> {
    // Returns hot potato for external resources
}

// Caller fulfills with actual resources
public fun fulfill_create_pool(
    request: ResourceRequest<CreatePoolAction>,
    asset_coin: Coin<AssetType>,   // External resource
    stable_coin: Coin<StableType>,  // External resource
): ResourceReceipt<CreatePoolAction>
```

### When to Use ResourceRequest

**Use ResourceRequest when action needs:**
1. **Shared objects** that can't be stored in Account (AMM pools, ProposalQueues)
2. **External coins** from users (not from DAO vault)
3. **Special capabilities** like TreasuryCap for minting

**Don't use ResourceRequest for:**
- Config updates (modify Account directly)
- Vault operations (coins already in Account)
- Stream management (streams stored in Account)
- Dissolution actions (use Account's resources)

### Files Updated in Remove-ExecutionContext Commit
- Removed `action_results.move` - No longer needed
- Removed `security_council_*_with_placeholders.move` - Deprecated pattern
- Updated `executable.move` - Removed ExecutionContext
- Updated `vault.move`, `currency.move` - Removed context usage
- Updated all action files - Removed placeholder fields
- Simplified liquidity actions - Direct ID passing
