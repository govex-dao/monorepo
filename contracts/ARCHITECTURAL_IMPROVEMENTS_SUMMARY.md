# Architectural Improvements Summary

## Priority 1: ✅ PTB-Based Execution Model Implemented

### What Was Done:
1. **Chose PTB Model**: Confirmed PTB-based execution as the primary pattern
2. **Removed Old Dispatcher**: Deprecated `futarchy_dao::execute` module containing monolithic dispatcher
3. **Enhanced PTB Executor**: Updated `execute_ptb.move` with proper validation
4. **Added Finalizer Validation**: `execute_proposal_end` now verifies ALL actions were executed

### Key Changes in `execute_ptb.move`:
```move
// Added validation to ensure all actions are executed
assert!(executed_actions == total_actions, ENotAllActionsExecuted);
```

### Pattern for do_* Functions:
Every `do_*` function must follow this pattern:
1. Check action type: `assert!(executable::is_current_action<Outcome, ActionType>(executable), EWrongAction);`
2. Get and deserialize BCS data from ActionSpec
3. Execute the action logic
4. Increment index: `executable::increment_action_idx(executable);`

## Priority 2: ✅ Mandatory Schema Validation Enforced

### What Was Done:
1. **Created Validated Add Function**: Added `add_action_validated` in `action_specs.move`
2. **Registry Integration**: All proposal submission functions now require `ActionDecoderRegistry`
3. **Validation at Entry Points**: `proposal_submission.move` validates all actions have decoders

### Key Implementation:
```move
// In action_specs.move
public fun add_action_validated(
    specs: &mut InitActionSpecs,
    registry: &ActionDecoderRegistry,
    action_type: TypeName,
    action_data: vector<u8>
) {
    // Enforce decoder exists
    schema::assert_decoder_exists(registry, action_type);
    // Add action
}
```

## Priority 3: ✅ Refined Garbage Collection

### What Was Done:
1. **Created Efficient GC**: New `improved_janitor.move` that reads action types from Expired
2. **Added DeleteHookRegistry**: Extensible pattern for registering cleanup functions
3. **Eliminated Wasteful Attempts**: Only tries to delete actions that actually exist

### Key Improvements:
- Reads `action_specs` from Expired to know exact types present
- Maintains registry of delete hooks for extensibility
- Processes each type only once (deduplication)

## Remaining Work

### High Priority:
1. **Fix Remaining do_* Functions**: Complete conversion of all do_* functions in config_actions.move to proper PTB pattern
2. **Update Other Action Modules**: Apply same PTB pattern to all action modules

### Medium Priority:
1. **Remove CancelWitness.key Field**: Clean up deprecated field
2. **Consolidate Utils**: Ensure single utils package

## Critical Pattern Requirements

### For All do_* Functions:
```move
public fun do_action_name<Outcome: store, IW: drop>(
    executable: &mut Executable<Outcome>,
    account: &mut Account<FutarchyConfig>,
    version: VersionWitness,
    intent_witness: IW,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    // 1. MANDATORY: Check action type
    assert!(executable::is_current_action<Outcome, ActionType>(executable), EWrongAction);

    // 2. Get BCS data
    let specs = executable::intent(executable).action_specs();
    let spec = specs.borrow(executable::action_idx(executable));
    let action_data = protocol_intents::action_spec_data(spec);

    // 3. Check version
    let spec_version = protocol_intents::action_spec_version(spec);
    assert!(spec_version == 1, EUnsupportedActionVersion);

    // 4. Deserialize
    let action: ActionType = bcs::from_bytes(*action_data);

    // 5. Execute logic
    // ... action implementation ...

    // 6. MANDATORY: Increment index
    executable::increment_action_idx(executable);
}
```

## Security Improvements

1. **Action Order Enforcement**: PTB pattern ensures actions execute in exact order
2. **Complete Execution Guarantee**: Finalizer ensures all actions are executed
3. **Type Safety**: Compile-time type checking with TypeName-based routing
4. **Schema Transparency**: All actions must have registered decoders

## Gas Efficiency Improvements

1. **No Monolithic Dispatcher**: Eliminates large if/else chains
2. **Direct Function Calls**: PTB calls specific do_* functions directly
3. **Efficient GC**: Only attempts to delete actions that exist
4. **No Table Storage**: Hot potato pattern avoids ExecutionContext tables

## Next Steps

1. Complete conversion of all do_* functions to PTB pattern
2. Test end-to-end proposal execution with new pattern
3. Deploy improved GC system
4. Document PTB composition patterns for developers
