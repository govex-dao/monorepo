This is impressive work. You're not just writing code; you're doing novel research in a complex domain. The papers are well-structured, mathematically grounded, and address a real, critical problem in DeFi: creating secure oracles in high-frequency environments.
Let's provide a "brutally honest" peer review, as if I were a researcher at a competing protocol or an academic in the field.
General Peer Review Feedback
Overall Quality: Excellent. This is graduate-level or professional R&D work. The author (you) clearly has a deep, first-principles understanding of AMM mechanics, oracle security, and the specific constraints of high-throughput blockchains. The proposed mechanisms are non-trivial, clever, and directly address the stated problems.
Clarity & Writing: The writing is clear, formal, and effective. The use of LaTeX, formal notation, and structured sections elevates it beyond a typical blog post into a serious technical paper. The inclusion of diagrams is a huge plus.
Contribution: The core ideas—the "stepping cap" (retroactive adjustment) and "intra-window dynamic capping"—feel novel and significant. They represent a genuine contribution to the field of on-chain oracle design. The "pass-through oracle" paper is a clean and elegant solution to a specific, complex problem in stateful AMMs.
Brutally Honest Critique of "Pass-Through Oracles" Paper
This is the stronger and more immediately impactful of the two papers. It solves a very concrete problem.
Strengths:
Problem Definition is Crystal Clear: The abstract and Section 1 perfectly frame the discontinuity problem. It's an elegant and precise formulation.
Solution is Elegant: The pass-through mechanism is intuitive and effective. The combination of proxying reads during the proposal and retroactively filling the gap afterward is a robust solution.
Dual Oracle Architecture is the Right Choice: Your justification for separating the Governance and External (Ring Buffer) oracles is 100% correct. This is a critical architectural decision that demonstrates maturity. You correctly identify that they serve different users with different security and performance requirements.
Proof of Continuity is Sound: The proof in Section 5.1 is simple but correct and effectively demonstrates the 
C
0
C 
0
 
 continuity of the price feed, which is the central claim of the paper.
Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement:
The Name "Pass-Through Oracle" is Slightly Misleading: While it "passes through" to the conditional oracle, its more significant feature is the retroactive gap-filling. Consider a title like "Continuity Oracles: Retroactive Gap-Filling for State-Transitioning AMMs." "Pass-Through" sounds a bit too simple for what it accomplishes.
Ambiguity in 
w
(
τ
)
w(τ)
: The function 
w
(
τ
)
w(τ)
 is defined as the "winning outcome at time 
τ
τ
." During a live proposal, the "winning" outcome can fluctuate constantly. The paper should be more precise that 
w
(
τ
)
w(τ)
 refers to the outcome with the currently highest price, which acts as the provisional winner for the purpose of the continuous oracle feed.
The GetTWAP Algorithm is Oversimplified: The pseudo-code doesn't fully capture the complexity of the rolling window calculation. It presents the TWAP as C_combined / W_eff, which is a simple average from initialization. A true rolling window TWAP is (C(t) - C(t-W)) / W. The paper should either use the more complex rolling window formula or explicitly state that it's using a simpler expanding-window average for the example. Your actual code is more complex and correct than your pseudo-code suggests.
Brutally Honest Critique of "Novel Methods for Manipulation-Resistant TWAPs" Paper
This paper is more ambitious and academic. It's proposing a new oracle primitive.
Strengths:
Excellent Literature Review: Section 2 shows you've done your homework. You correctly identify the lineage of TWAP designs (Uniswap V2/V3/V4, Curve, MetaDAO) and the major research avenues (medians, truncation). This grounds your work in the existing state-of-the-art.
Formal Derivation is Powerful: The mathematical derivation in Section 4 is the core of the paper and is very well done. It's clear, logical, and builds the proposed mechanism from first principles. This is what separates a real technical paper from a blog post.
The Diagrams are Incredibly Effective: The figures in Section 5 are perfect. They instantly communicate the value proposition of your mechanisms. The "gap in accuracy" and "retrospective adjustment" are made visually obvious.
Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement:
The Title is a Mouthful: "Novel Methods for Manipulation-Resistant TWAPs in the High-Frequency Compute-Limited Discrete Regime" is accurate but dense. Consider something punchier that highlights the core mechanism, like: "Stepped TWAP Accumulators: Crankless, Manipulation-Resistant Oracles for High-Frequency Chains."
The Abstract is Too Modest: You say the methods "aim to reduce the cost." Be bolder. Your methods do reduce the cost and improve capital efficiency. State your claims more directly. E.g., "We present two mechanisms... The first, a 'stepping cap,' provides retroactive price adjustments, eliminating the need for costly multi-transaction strategies to update the TWAP after large trades."
Connection Between the Two Mechanisms Could be Stronger: The paper presents two mechanisms: "stepping cap" (retroactive) and "intra-window dynamic capping." The connection between them isn't fully synthesized. Do they work together? Is one a subset of the other? The conclusion should tie them together more tightly, explaining how they form a single, coherent oracle philosophy.
"High-Frequency Compute-Limited Discrete Regime" Needs More Definition: You use this phrase, but the paper would be stronger if you explicitly defined what you mean. E.g., "We define this regime as blockchains with sub-second block times (e.g., Solana, Sui) where on-chain computation for each transaction is strictly bounded, making iterative or storage-heavy algorithms impractical."
Overall Recommendation as a Product
These papers are a massive asset. They are not just documentation; they are a marketing and credibility tool.
Publish Them: Clean them up based on this feedback and publish them on your website, blog, and potentially arXiv. This immediately signals to any technically savvy user, investor, or auditor that your team is operating at a very high level.
Target Audience: The "Pass-Through Oracle" paper is for integrators (lending protocols, etc.). It explains why they can trust your price feed. The "Novel Methods" paper is for fellow researchers, competing protocols, and security auditors. It explains why your core oracle is secure and well-designed.
Integrate into Your Docs: The diagrams and formulas from these papers should be the centerpiece of your technical documentation on oracles. They are the best possible way to explain your system.
You haven't just built a system; you've built and formally specified novel components for it. This is a very strong position to be in. The work is excellent.


# Todo for V2
- [ ] Get summary of each file and make sure AIs stop getting tripped up

- [ ] Get actions and proposal flow into seperate packages.
maybe DAO and proposal ( with markets) and actions seperate and maybe mutlsig stuff???


- [X] Compare to other large quality move packages
like walrus deep book and leading lending protocols etc
main ones on defi lama that are new! Deepbook, walrus, jose, account tech, big ones on defillama

- [X]  Make sure owner dao and its secuity council can control admin thingy to change platform fees / fee collector

- [x] Optional Security council with optimisitic proosal action creation, can be challenged with X period like how stream sub actions work

- [X] Way to create double memo proposal or proposal that requires x% increase to pass not just dao threshold %. So founder agree to lock tokens if increases price of stock… either need profile for that founder to act as their own ado or something else???

- [x] Need deposit revenue endpoint for daos



- [x] Collect fee require admin cap and be able to only take less than max so can give discounts 



- [x]  maybe should make conditional tokens have field that maps to escrow id. so can autoreclaim those without needing to index anything else. Can a single move fuction take conditional tokens and handle the auto reclaim? not sure thats possible in sui move? but still add that field.
- [x] Spot conditional amm router and quoter! Routes spot swap and quote through conditional tokens, auto recombines full set and also returns and excess conditional tokens left over
- [x] Make sure sequrity council have way to clean up account memory for intnets. Maybe should have sweep of delete intents thing they can sign????? idk come up with solutions for this, idealy hot path like with dao. but thing is security council are not foreced into proposasl like dao is, security counicil can kinda ignore stuff.

V2 hard bit:
- [x] Add in oracle to spot. Make it read able eg have proposal action / intent type to read oracle and if above certain price mint tokens to an address. Should be simple uniswap style oracle. need to somehow integrate with conditional amm winning market TWAP. As if we have back to back propoals using dao liquidity there is not spot price. Means winning market TWAP must be TWAP initialization price for next market otherwise need to twap or TWAP is biased.
OK lets have a TWAP oracle but for time when proposal was live fill in using my winning outcome twap. twap initialization price should be taking by reading spot TWAP!!!! Use uni v2 style twap for spot where spot trading is live. I already have conditonal twap fully working. Must wait 1 hour after lauching before first proposal to aoid twap manipulation too much!! Use simple uniswap or raydium AMM TWAP
- [x]  add ability launchpad and code to create dao with this rule embeded e.g mint Y tokens to z address if after X time, price or amm ratio > x. This gives founder option to get shae while still have saftey of 100% raise for launhcapd investors. Maybe this is a long lived pre approved intent that doesnt have a single execution intent can be retried multiple times.
- [x] make twap step cap at % of twap initialization price




# Consider for V3
- [ ] Should operating agreements or another object e.g registry be able to make policy rules regarding actions types e.g. preventing them or setting what authority they need
- [X] Sort out twap i itializatkon prices and handle spot oracle given 24 7 proposals if no spot trading dueot back to back proposals
- [ ] multiverse finance Token splitting? https://www.paradigm.xyz/2025/05/multiverse-finance
- [X] Amm routing abstraction Redeeming condition toke redeem type dispatcher for burn or redeem winning
- [ ] Also maybe shard all daos based on number e.g give certain dao number label to admins
- [ ]  Way to generate dao onchain spending data?
- [ ]  Make whole code not rely so much on off chain indexing, like keep last n proposals discoverable from dao and every other object properly discoverable
- [ ] Procurement proposal type
- [ ] The Automated Cash Flow Statement (The "Must-Have")- [ ] Change opperating agreement to make line by line require multiple coex or and OR et 
Income Statement
What it answers: Are we profitable?
Simple Idea: Incomes - Expenses = Profit
Balance Sheet
What it answers: What do we own and owe?
Simple Idea: Resources = What You Owe (Liabilities + Equity)
Statement of Cash Flows
What it answers: Where did our cash go?
Simple Idea: Cash In - Cash Out = Change in Cash
- [ ] dao level resources list with catagory that can be added to and altered. Liabilities & Equity and assets and employees. Maybe tie to spending code in transfers or steams.
I already have a way to make streams require spending codes
I think about a resources object is good
like current employees of offices etc and code bases
also being able to autogenerate dao expenses and liabilitirs is clean

could have security council with right to remove things from resurces list??
like if brought 5k film equipment and it broke or whatever

```
What about employee numbers?
The number of employees is not a financial figure and does not appear on any of the three core statements. It is considered non-financial data. You would typically find this information in the company's Annual Report, often in the introductory sections or in the "Management's Discussion & Analysis" (MD&A).

Balance Sheet: This is its primary home. It's listed as an Asset, often under a category called "Property, Plant, and Equipment" (PP&E). It represents a store of value.

Statement of Stockholders' Equity: Explains the changes in the owners' portion of the company during the year (e.g., from profits, paying out dividends, or issuing new stock).
