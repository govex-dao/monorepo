# account.tech – Move Framework for Smart Accounts

![account.tech logo](./assets/accountdottech_logo.png)

> The historical README for this project described the upstream account.tech codebase. Since this repository has diverged significantly, treat that material as out of date and read the source (or current documentation in `contracts/move-framework`) for accurate details.

If you are trying to understand current behaviour, the best entry points are:
- `contracts/move-framework/packages/` – active Move packages (see `Move.toml` files inside each package)
- `contracts/move-framework/FORK_LICENSE_NOTICE.md` – licensing notes and file provenance
- Inline module documentation within each `.move` source file

Feel free to open an issue or read through the implementation plan documents if you need additional guidance. All new contributions should follow the licensing guidance in `FORK_LICENSE_NOTICE.md`.
