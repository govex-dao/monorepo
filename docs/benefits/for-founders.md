# For Founders

* We dog-food our own platform.
* No platform lock‑in!
* No hidden fees - protocol take 20%  of the AMM you set.
* Low latency due to a back‑end database, with no reliance on slow indexers.
* Full lifecycle support from DAO creation to token AMM liquidity actions to dissolution of the DAO.
* Ongoing support by engineers who are extremely committed to the project, not a short‑term grant‑extraction play.
