# For Founders

#### The Process

After TGE when you have your coin, visit [https://www.govex.ai/create](https://www.govex.ai/create) to create a DAO. Pick the following setting for your DAO:



1. **Min Asset Amount:** This is the minimum liquidity a proposer has to put up to create the AMMs. We recommend making it about 1% of your circulating supply and pairing it with enough USDC to match your spot price.
2. **Pre-trading Period:** The time your community gets to review the proposal before trading starts.
3. **TWAP Start Delay:** The delay between trading starting and the measurement of the average price beginning.
4. **Trading Period:** The total trading period.
