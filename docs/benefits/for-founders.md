# For Founders



* **Markets have been repeatedly proven to be at least as accurate as experts, if not better.** Use futarchy to get the best decisions for your company.
* **There are price incentives to correct others’ mistakes;** voting does not offer this.
* **There is a monetary incentive to conduct new research** and present it to the market and profit (e.g., a French Trump Polymarket buyer using neighbor polls).
* **Hard to manipulate or game the price.** Money is scarce, and in the long term, manipulators who move the price away from the fair value will lose money and thus remove themselves from the market (a self‑correcting system).
* **Can aggregate information from a wider base than just token holders.** Traders who are not token holders, and thus would not vote, can step in to correct short‑term price inefficiencies. They can arbitrage or go long or short.
* **No last‑minute surprise games** as with SIMD‑0228. Voting is a one‑off snapshot; trading is a continuous double auction with continuous measurement via a TWAP. The fair price evolves over time, making it more accurate than a one‑off snapshot.
* **Those with 51% of the vote cannot act as tyrants,** because minorities can exit at the fair market price.
* The only DAO management platform on Sui.
* Provides the option for the DAO to require an additional security multisig approval for any decision.
* Integrates with existing Move Framework types, so it matches community standards and is easily upgradable.
* Ongoing support by engineers who are extremely committed to the project, not a short‑term grant‑extraction play.
* Low latency due to a back‑end database, with no reliance on slow indexers.
* Proposal‑queue system with economic incentives to deter spam.
* Highly customizable system.
* Launchpad with an optional price cap for investors.
* Full lifecycle support from DAO creation to token AMM liquidity actions to dissolution of the DAO.
* No platform lock‑in!
* We use it ourselves.
