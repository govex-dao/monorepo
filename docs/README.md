# Welcome to Govex

## Introduction

The Govex platform allows communities to make decisions based on what will be best for their token price. Markets are best for evaluating decisions such as turning on a fee switch, changing product direction or minting new coins.

## Decision Markets

* **Markets have been repeatedly proven to be at least as accurate as experts, if not better.**&#x20;
* **There are price incentives to correct others’ mistakes;** voting does not offer this.
* **There is a monetary incentive to conduct new research** and present it to the market and profit (e.g., a French Trump Polymarket buyer using neighbor polls).
* **Hard to manipulate or game the price.** Money is scarce, so manipulators who move the price away from the fair value will lose money and thus remove themselves from the market (a self‑correcting system).
* **Can aggregate information from a wider base than just token holders.** Traders who are not token holders, and thus would not vote, can step in to correct short‑term price inefficiencies. They can arbitrage or go long or short.
* **No last‑minute surprise games** as with SIMD‑0228. Voting is a one‑off snapshot; trading is continuous measured by the Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP). The fair price evolves over time, making it more accurate than a one‑off snapshot.
* **Those with 51% of the vote cannot act as tyrants,** because minorities can exit at the fair market price.
