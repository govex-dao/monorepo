# Welcome to Govex

## Introduction

The Govex platform allows communities to create proposals and make decisions based on what is best for their token price. Markets are best for evaluating significant decisions such as turning on a fee switch, changing product direction or minting new coins. We call these markets that are used to make decisions, decision markets.

## Why Decision Markets?

* **Markets have been repeatedly proven to be at least as accurate as pannels of experts, if not better.**&#x20;
* **Markets have price incentives to correct the mistakes of others;** voting does not offer this.
* **There is a monetary incentive to conduct new research** and present it to the market and profit (e.g., a French Trump Polymarket buyer using neighbour polls).
* **Hard to manipulate or game the price.** Money is scarce, so manipulators who move the price away from the fair value will lose money and thus remove themselves from the market (a self‑correcting system).
* **Markets can aggregate information from a wider base than just token holders.** Traders who are not token holders, and thus would not vote, can step in to correct short‑term price inefficiencies. They can arbitrage or go long or short.
* **No last‑minute surprise games** as with SIMD‑0228. Voting is a one‑off snapshot; trading is continuous measured by the Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP). The fair price evolves over time, making it more accurate than a one‑off snapshot.
* **Those with 51% of the vote cannot act as tyrants,** because minorities can exit at the fair market price.
