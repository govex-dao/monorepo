# Welcome to Govex

## Decision Markets

The Govex platform allows communities to make decisions based on what will be best for their token price. We use Uniswap style V2 AMMs and conditional coins.\

## Use Markets to Make Decision

* **Markets have been repeatedly proven to be at least as accurate as experts, if not better.** Use futarchy to get the best decisions for your company.
* **There are price incentives to correct others’ mistakes;** voting does not offer this.
* **There is a monetary incentive to conduct new research** and present it to the market and profit (e.g., a French Trump Polymarket buyer using neighbor polls).
* **Hard to manipulate or game the price.** Money is scarce, and in the long term, manipulators who move the price away from the fair value will lose money and thus remove themselves from the market (a self‑correcting system).
* **Can aggregate information from a wider base than just token holders.** Traders who are not token holders, and thus would not vote, can step in to correct short‑term price inefficiencies. They can arbitrage or go long or short.
* **No last‑minute surprise games** as with SIMD‑0228. Voting is a one‑off snapshot; trading is a continuous double auction with continuous measurement via a TWAP. The fair price evolves over time, making it more accurate than a one‑off snapshot.
* **Those with 51% of the vote cannot act as tyrants,** because minorities can exit at the fair market price.
