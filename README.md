Govex is a DAO management platform on Sui.

It allows users to permissionlessly create DAOs and and proposals.

Instead of voting we use decision markets as the consensus mechanism for evaluating whether a proposal should pass or fail.

Users can trade on what the predicted price of their DAO's native token is if a given proposal was to be accepted or rejected.

This mechanism is much more efficent than voting and also protects DAO holders while also boosting engagement.


Our mission is to become the default operating system for onchain capital. We are the leading DAO management platform on Sui. Sui move's unique safety and power along with its auxiliary protocols allowed us to build the most powerful smart contracts in the industry.
We have built Git for finance, a new primitive that enables transparent, auditable, and collaborative on-chain operations. This foundational technology will unlock entirely new forms of companies, DAOs and ETFs etc.
Our platform empowers DAOs to intelligently design their governance with highly customizable combinations of futarchy and multisig, allowing for granular, policy-driven control over every action.
