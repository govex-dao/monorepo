Govex is a DAO management platform on Sui.

It allows users to permissionlessly create DAOs and and proposals.

Instead of voting we use decision markets as the consensus mechanism for evaluating whether a proposal should pass or fail.

Users can trade on what the predicted price of their DAO's native token is if a given proposal was to be accepted or rejected.

This mechanism is much more efficent than voting and also protects DAO holders while also boosting engagement.
