# Real-time Swap Events Update Analysis

## Current State
- Frontend fetches swap events via REST API using React Query
- Users must manually refresh to see updates
- Backend has REST endpoints only, no WebSocket/GraphQL support
- The indexer continuously monitors blockchain events

## Solution Comparison

### 1. Polling (Short-term, Recommended) ‚úÖ
**Pros:**
- Minimal backend changes needed
- Works with existing REST infrastructure
- React Query has built-in polling support
- Quick to implement

**Cons:**
- Network overhead with frequent requests
- Not truly real-time (1-second intervals)
- Scales poorly with many users

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In useSwapEvents.ts
refetchInterval: 1000, // Poll every second
refetchIntervalInBackground: true
```

### 2. WebSockets (Long-term, Best) üöÄ
**Pros:**
- True real-time updates
- Efficient - server pushes only when new events occur
- Scales well
- Lower latency

**Cons:**
- Requires significant backend changes
- Need to add socket.io or ws library
- More complex error handling/reconnection logic

**Backend Requirements:**
- Add socket.io to package.json
- Create WebSocket server alongside Express
- Emit events from indexer when new swaps detected

### 3. GraphQL Subscriptions ‚ùå
**Pros:**
- Type-safe real-time updates
- Good for complex data requirements

**Cons:**
- Overkill for simple swap events
- Requires complete backend rewrite
- Adds significant complexity
- Team would need GraphQL expertise

## Recommendation

### Phase 1 (Immediate): Polling
Implement polling with React Query's `refetchInterval` to provide automatic updates every second. This requires minimal changes and provides immediate value.

### Phase 2 (Future): WebSockets
Plan migration to WebSockets for true real-time updates. This should be done when:
- User base grows and polling becomes inefficient
- Team has bandwidth for backend refactoring
- Real-time updates become critical for UX

## Implementation Plan for Polling

1. Update `useSwapEvents` hook with refetch interval
2. Add visual indicator when new data arrives
3. Optimize React Query cache to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. Consider adding a "pause updates" button for user control
5. Monitor performance impact and adjust interval if needed
