# Operating Agreement Introduction
This operating agreement is the standard MiDAO DAO operating agreement with four unique differences.

1. Greshams Code is the legal managing member and has the power to change the governance mechanism where bugs or edge cases arise, and also has the power but not the obligation to represent the DAO when interfacing with legacy institutions, when doing so saves the DAO money or time.

2. The standard governance mechanism of the DAO is decision markets, but when one person holds all units of the Govex token. They can decide for the DAO without decision having to go through decision markets. (Only likely to ever apply pre-launch)

3. To change the operating agreement, a git style diff must be approved by the governance mechanism.

4. Greshams Code is indemnified by the DAO for nearly everything. (Excluding acting in bad faith or engaging in deceptive practices.)
