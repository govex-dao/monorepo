# Operating Agreement Introduction
This operating agreement is the standard MiDAO DAO opperating agreement with four unique differences.

1. Greshams Code is the legal managember and has power to over change the governance mechanism where bugs or edges are found and also has the power but not the obligation to represent the DAO when interfacing with legacy institutions, when doing so saves the DAO money or time.

2. The standard governance mechanism of the DAO is decision markets but when one person contains all units of the Govex token. They can decide for the DAO without decision having to go through decision markets.(Only likly to ever apply pre-launch)

3. To change the opperating agreement a git style diff must be approved by the governane mechanism.

4. Greshams Code is indemified by the DAO for nearly everything. (Exluding acting in bad faith or engaging in deceptive practices.)
